This project, created for the Industrial Networks II course, emphasizes the implementation of network protocols in an industrial control system dedicated to beverage pasteurization. We designed a custom Modbus Slave that interfaced with the Siemens S7-1200 PLC, itself connected to a Profinet network. The main goal was to achieve smooth integration between Profinet and Modbus TCP protocols, facilitating the connection of our device and a three-phase motor/inverter, with the Siemens S7-1200 PLC.

## Features

- **Multiprotocol Integration:** The project showcases the coexistence of Profinet and Modbus TCP protocols within an industrial setting, providing a comprehensive solution for network communication.

- **PLC Control:** Utilizing the Siemens S7-1200 PLC for effective control and coordination of a motor, ensuring a reliable and efficient industrial process.

- **Raspberry Pi Data Collection:** A Raspberry Pi board is employed for data collection and transmission within the Modbus remote system, enhancing the project's versatility.

- **Practical Application:** Emphasizing the practical application of network protocols, the project addresses real-world industrial challenges, specifically in the context of beverage pasteurization.
