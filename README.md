This project, developed for the discipline of Industrial Networks II, focuses on the development and implementation of aremote device part of an industrial control system dedicated to the pasteurization of beverages. The system was succesfull connected on a real industrial environment and communicate with a Profinet and Modbus TCP network, facilitated by thePLC Siemens S7-1200 PLC.

The aim was to, throught this remote system, simulate a device in the factory floor, responsible for monitor and control the temperature of a tank containing liquid to be pausterized 
## Features

- **Multiprotocol Integration:** The project showcases the coexistence of Profinet and Modbus TCP protocols within an industrial setting, providing a comprehensive solution for network communication.

- **PLC Control:** Utilizing the Siemens S7-1200 PLC for effective control and coordination, ensuring a reliable and efficient industrial process.

- **Raspberry Pi Data Collection:** A Raspberry Pi board is employed for data collection and transmission within the Modbus remote system, enhancing the project's versatility.

- **Practical Application:** Emphasizing the practical application of network protocols, the project addresses real-world industrial challenges, specifically in the context of beverage pasteurization.

## System Architecture

The system architecture involves the collaboration between the Siemens S7-1200 PLC, responsible for protocol integration, and the Raspberry Pi for data handling within the Modbus network.
