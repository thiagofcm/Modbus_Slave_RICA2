This project, developed for the Industrial Networks II discipline, focuses on the implementation of network protocols in an industrial control system dedicated to the pasteurization of beverages. We developed our own Modbus Slave which was connected to the Siemens S7-1200 PLC, that was connected to a Profinet network. The primary objective was to achieve seamless integration between Profinet and Modbus TCP protocols, connecting our device, a three-phase motor/inverter and the Siemens S7-1200 PLC.

## Features

- **Multiprotocol Integration:** The project showcases the coexistence of Profinet and Modbus TCP protocols within an industrial setting, providing a comprehensive solution for network communication.

- **PLC Control:** Utilizing the Siemens S7-1200 PLC for effective control and coordination of a motor, ensuring a reliable and efficient industrial process.

- **Raspberry Pi Data Collection:** A Raspberry Pi board is employed for data collection and transmission within the Modbus remote system, enhancing the project's versatility.

- **Practical Application:** Emphasizing the practical application of network protocols, the project addresses real-world industrial challenges, specifically in the context of beverage pasteurization.
